No change this week at the top 2 positions of our weekly rankings.

The collection of snippets from _30 seconds of code_ project keeps up growing at a fast pace.

In addition of the snippets for both the browser and Node.js, the project contains a glossary of about 100 terms related to JavaScript.

At position number 2, _Trix_ is a rich text editor for modern browsers, made by Basecamp.

It lets non-technical users create and edit content right from the browser ("What you see is what you get"), which is usually a key feature of CMS applications.

The top page of their web site is an example made with the editor so go and check if you want to see it in action.
