Number 1 this week, _GrapeJS_ is a tool tp create HTML page builder.

It provides a UI that lets users create HTML structures by dragging blocks, without coding anything.

_GrapeJS_ is highly customizable and can be used to create your own CMS, tailored to your needs, that you can embed into any web application.

After watermelons last week, we celebrate grapes this week... it's the season of fruits!

At position 2 and 8, _Day.js_ and _date-fns_ are 2 libraries to manipulate Date and Time that are a smaller alternative to the very popular _Moment.js_ library. Both are mentioned in [You don't need Moment.js](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs) project.
