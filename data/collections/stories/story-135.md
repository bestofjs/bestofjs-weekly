Hello JavaScript fans, happy new year 2021 to all of you!

Our first newsletter of the year is about _Twind_, a library to integrate easily [Tailwin CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in any web application built with frameworks such as React, Vue or Svelte.

Tailwind CSS is a "utility-first" CSS framework that provides naming conventions to let developers style pages and components by composing class names.

According to the [State of CSS](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/report/) beautiful report, it's the CSS framework that has the highest ratio of satisfaction among the developers who made the survey.

Back to _Twind_, the main difference with using TailwindCSS directly is that you don't have to process the class names at build time using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), the CSS code is generated at run time.

It works by providing a function `tw()` that lets developers handle class names easily using an intuitive syntax.

One more thing: next week, our annual _Rising Stars_ will come back... I hope it makes you as excited as I am!
