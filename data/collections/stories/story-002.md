Welcome to the second issue of Best of JavaScript Weekly!

This week, the project number 1 is "deno", a prototype by Ryan Dahl, the creator of node.js.

In an interesting [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA), Ryan explains several things he doesn't like about node.js and even expresses regrets.

But rather than just lamenting, Ryan addresses the issues he mentions by releasing this "secure TypeScript runtime built on V8" ("de no" is an anagram of "no de" if you struggle remembering the name!).

Among interesting things, a TypeScript compiler is included in the box and it's possible to import any source file from any URL... like the `<script>` tags in the good old web pages!

Talking about TypeScript, it's one of the projects from Microsoft in the TOP 10 this week, along with VS Code editor.

Of course, the breaking news of the week was [the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/).

Over the last months, Microsoft did a lot of things to become one of the main actors in the JavaScript world, check in _Best of JavaScript_ some of [the projects related to Microsoft](https://bestofjs.org/search/microsoft).

So it may not be so surprising to see a giant like Microsoft taking control of our beloved GitHub... but what a turnaround in the history of Open Source!
