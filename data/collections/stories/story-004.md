No change at the first two spots this week, _Vue.js_ and _React_ keep leading the way after last week's epic fight.

React is still more popular according to [this article](https://zendev.com/2018/06/19/react-usage-beating-vue-angular.html), considering that the number of stars on GitHub and the real usage by developers are 2 different things.

Among the new projects this week, [Docz](https://docz.site/) lets developers create beautiful documentation for their React components, using a new syntax called `mdx`, a mix of markdown and jsx markup.

[Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) is a framework to build native mobile applications. It's not the equivalent of _React Native_ because actually it's built on top of _React Native_.

Speaking about _React Native_, the folks at Airbnb wrote [a thorough feedback](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) about their 2-year experience.
