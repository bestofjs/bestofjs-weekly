Hello JavaScript fans!
From this week our newsletter includes a new section called "New Faces" with the latest projects added to _Best of JS_.

As usual you will find our rankings led this week by _Aleph_, which is the equivalent of Next.js in the [Deno](https://deno.land/) world: a full-stack framework to render applications in both backend and frontend sides, using React components.

Among the big trends this week, let's mention the release of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 2.0, the CSS framework that made popular the "utility classes" to let developers style easily any content in a web page.

Reach us on GitHub if you have any feedback about the newsletter format, thank you!
