Number one this week, _Diagram Maker_ is a library outsourced by AWS to visualize graph data structure in the browser.

Basically a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is made of "nodes" connected by "edges" (arrows between the nodes, with a source and destination).

_Diagram Maker_ can be used to visualize a workflow with different states and events that trigger transition between states.
It's used in the modelling tool of the AWS "IoT Events" service to let users represent the state of their devices.

Under the hood, it's built on top of the state management library Redux and the UI library Preact, the most popular lightweight alternative to React.

Check the category [Diagram / Flow charts](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=diagram) if you are interested in this type of visualization.
