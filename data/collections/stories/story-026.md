Number one this week, _Nivo_ is a data visualization library for React made by our friend Raphaël Benitte.

It provides 15 kinds of chart components including bar charts, calendars, tree maps, heat maps...

To see the _Nivo_ components in action while learning about the JavaScript landscape, check the results of our annual survey: [2018 State of JavaScript](https://2018.stateofjs.com/).

This year too, Sacha Grief and Raphaël Benitte did an amazing work to gather the answers from more than 20,000 developers, provide useful insights and beautiful visualizations... powered by _Nivo_ of course!
