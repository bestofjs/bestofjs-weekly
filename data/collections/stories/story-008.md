7 weeks later, _JS Algorithms & Data Structures_, our first winner, is the number one, again.

A lot of new algorithms, for beginners and advanced users, have been added. It's a great way to learn while practicing a test-driven development approach.

_Create React App_, number 10 this week, is the de-facto standard to easily bootstrap a new React project but it lacks a Server-Side Rendering solution out of the box.

At position number 3, _Rogue.js_ is a project that fills the blank. This solution is able to infer all the routes of your application by walking through the tree of the components... This is smart!

Also, it's built on top _Parcel_, number 4 this week, a module bundler that has become very trendy over the last months.

It claims to be faster and simpler than _Webpack_, that is used by _Create React App_ under the hood.
