Number one this week, _Tiny-Swiper_ is a lightweight alternative to [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) one of the most popular libraries to create sliders (also called "carousels") in the browser.

The API is similar but _Tiny-Swiper_ weights only 2 kB, instead of 33 kB, while offering the main features (including navigation with the mouse-wheel and control of the level of resistance when dragging the slides).
