Hello dear readers, this week we are excited to introduce the new [Best of JavaScript](https://bestofjs.org/)!

The most obvious change is the new layout that emphasizes the search feature. Say goodbye to the huge sidebar, say hello to the new search engine!

The new search engine lets you combine tags and full-text search, in the same input box.

So now you can pick one or several tags or you can enter keywords if you search for a given project... or you can do both!

Also if you pick a generic tag such as "Component Toolbox", we show a list of related tags so that you can **refine you search** if you want to see only the projects related to React or Vue.js, for example, it's one of the most common use-cases.

Please have a try and let us know what you think on [GitHub](https://github.com/bestofjs/bestofjs-webui)!
