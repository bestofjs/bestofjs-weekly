This week, _Vue.js_ and _React_, the 2 most popular UI frameworks are at the top of the rankings.

These 2 projects have more than 100,000 stars on GitHub and it's worth mentioning that _Vue.js_ passed _React_ this week, becoming the most popular project in the [UI frameworks](https://bestofjs.org/tags/framework) category.

This battle has been very disputed over the last week. On the 14th, Dan Abramov, from the React team, congratulated the Vue.js team on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1007439168400654336).

It may explain why there was so much activity about GitHub stars this week, the fans from both sides trying to push their champion.

At number 3, last week's leader _deno_ despite being a "non-functional prototype" (according to its creator Ryan Dahl) keeps getting a lot of attention.
