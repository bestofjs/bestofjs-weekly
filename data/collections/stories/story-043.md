Number one this week, _Laxxx_ is a library to animate elements in the browser as the user scrolls through the page.

It's very simple to use, you just have to add "data-attributes" to the elements you want to animate, using arrays of numbers to specify the scrolling position.

It comes with some "presets" to create common effects such as "fade" or "blur" when the element enter the viewport.

If you are interested in scrolling effects, you may find other interesting projects under the [Scrolling](https://bestofjs.org/tags/scrolling) tag of _Best of JavaScript_.
