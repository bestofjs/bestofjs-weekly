This week too _Neo.mjs_, the UI framework that runs on web workers is the project growing at the fastest pace.

In terms of number of stars added this week, _Tesseract.js_ is at the top.

We mentioned this project that does OCR in the browser and in Node.js in the [issue number 58](https://weekly.bestofjs.org/issues/58/).

The version number 2 has just been released and the author explains in [this article](https://medium.com/@jeromewus/why-i-refactor-tesseract-js-v2-50f750a9cfe2) why he refactored the library, especially to fix issues related to performance.

One more thing: the results of the [State of Javascript](https://2019.stateofjs.com/) survey have been published. Go and check it, it's a great way to understand the JavaScript landscape in 2019.
