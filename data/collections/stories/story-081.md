Number one this week, _Neo.mjs_ is a UI framework that runs on web workers in order to deliver "extreme performance".

JavaScript in the browser uses only one thread but [Web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) are a solution to perform computationally expensive tasks without blocking the main thread.

The project is still at an early stage but the concept is promising.
