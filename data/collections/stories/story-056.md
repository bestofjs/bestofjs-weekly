No change at the top of the rankings this week, _Algorithm Visualizer_ keeps growing at a fast pace.

At position number 2, `jExcel` is a Vanilla JavaScript plugin that provides spreadsheets features for your web page.

The user experience is really close to a web application like Google Sheets or a software like Excel.

Let's mention a few of the amazing features:

- Edit the content of any cell using custom widgets (such as dropdown menus, date pickers, check-boxes...) depending on the type of data
- Insert or delete rows and columns by using a context menu
- Resize columns by drag and drop
- Select range of cells and copy-paste to Excel... and vice-versa!
