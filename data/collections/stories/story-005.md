_Vue.js_ is number one for the third consecutive week.

ES2018, the latest specification of the JavaScript language, has been officially published this week.

Let's have a look at the main features of this specification:

- Object "rest" properties and spread operator (dot dot dot `...`)
- Asynchronous iterators: you can use `for await` to loop through iterators that return Promises
- Promise.finally(), useful to run statements whenever a Promise either resolves or rejects
- Features related to regular expressions (`RegExp`), including the "named capture group".

For more details, check [Whatâ€™s new in ECMAScript 2018](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/javascript-whats-new-in-ecmascript-2018-es2018-17ede97f36d5).

Note that _Create React App_, in the TOP 10 this week, lets you write React applications taking advantage of a lot of the recent additions to the JavaScript language, including the rest properties and the spread operator.

Asynchronous iterators are supported in node.js 10, they can be used to consume a stream of data as mentioned in [this article](http://2ality.com/2018/04/async-iter-nodejs.html) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.

If you want to dive right into the code and see asynchronous iterators in action, you can run this simple [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/michaelrambeau/5e170008d6605df4d052b2d3acb3887d) that I've wrote especially for my dear readers. Feel free to comment!
