At position number one, *Ky* is a library to make HTTP requests from the browser.

It's a very tiny wrapper around the browser "fetch" API, that can be used instead of _Axios_ for example.

It's made by one of the most prolific Node.js developers, Sindre Sorhus, who has more than [1000 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus) on NPM.

His micro packages, incredibly small in size and scope, are always right to the point!

Last but not least, we have launched the [State of JavaScript 2018](https://stateofjs.com/) survey... let us know the JavaScript libraries you use!
