_Cleave.js_ number 4 last week, climbs the charts to get the top position this week.

For formatting an input field while the user is typing, we could also mention [Text Mask](https://text-mask.github.io/text-mask/).

At position number 2, _Zero_ is a new Node.js server that aims to provide the simplest developer experience, requiring "zero configuration", hence the name.

From a bunch of files at the root of your project you get a web server handling everything, the routing is made according to the file names.

Files served by a Zero server can be HTML files (of course), JSX, Markdown, but also MDX (a mix of JSX and Markdown).

The project reminds a bit [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and the philosophy of the web bundler [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a popular alternative to Webpack whose main feature is also the "zero configuration" developer experience.
