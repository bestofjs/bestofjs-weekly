This week too _React Chrono_ is the project growing at the fastest pace.

At the position number 2, _Luckysheet_ is a library to create spreadsheets in the browser.

Excel and Google Sheets users should feel at home with a lot of familiar features including formulas, drag and drop interactions, multiple options to format cells... Check the [online demo](https://mengshukeji.github.io/LuckysheetDemo/) to see the features in action.

Among the trendiest projects of the week, _eDEX-UI_ the science-fiction terminal we already mentioned in July, got a lot of traction.
