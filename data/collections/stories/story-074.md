The project number one is the same as last week: _roughViz.js_, a library to create charts with a hand-written effect.

It reminds us [PaperCSS](https://getpapercss.com/) this CSS framework that provides UI components with similar hand-written effects.

At position number 2, _RxDB_ is a reactive database, built on top of [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), that can be embedded in any application. Its main points:

- Users can subscribe to streams of data making it very appropriate for applications with real-time needs
- Queries are written with the same syntax as MongoDB
- Schemas follow the JSON-Schema specification
- Offline capabilities
- Synchronization with databases using plugins (GraphQL, CouchDB...)
