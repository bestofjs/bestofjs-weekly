_JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures_ is our project number one, again. It denotes how developers are eager to learn the basics and the advanced concepts of programming using JavaScript.

The project has been translated in 7 languages.

At position number 2, _Puppeteer Recorder_ is a Chrome extension that records scripts to control a headless browser, right from the browser.

It can be used to do automatic testing, to do web scrapping (the process of collecting information from static web pages) or to request all the steps to reproduce a bug that happened to a user.

At position number 9, we'd like to point out a project from Francisco Presencia, a friend of ours. _Umbrella_ is a modern and lightweight alternative to jQuery (only 2.51 kB once minified and gzipped).
