Number one this week, _BullMQ_ is a solution to handle asynchronous queues of tasks in Node.js, using Redis as a database.

It's the next major version of [Bull](https://bestofjs.org/projects/bull), the most popular project in the [Queues](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=queue) category.

Also, I'd like to mention a small update about _Best of JavaScript_: you can know sort projects by monthly number of downloads on NPM, for any category.

And the most downloaded package over the last month is `Debug` a simple but very useful tool to print nice messages in the console depending on the environment, that works in both Node.js and the browser.
