This is the very first issue of [Best of JavaScript Weekly](https://weekly.bestofjs.org) newsletter.

Every week, you will find here the 10 trendiest projects from [Best of JavaScript](https://weekly.bestofjs.org) application, a curated list of projects related to the web platform and node.js.

The first winner is a project called [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms), it has been very hot over the last days (almost 1000 stars added on GitHub every day!)

It's a great resource to learn basics of computer sciences algorithms (quicksort, binary search...) and data structures (tree, linked list, graph...).

For developers coming from other languages, who are already familiar with the concepts, it's also nice to see modern JavaScript in action, including testing with Jest.

An other interesting project related to data structure implementation in JavaScript: [Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures) from James Kyle.

If you are interested in learning resources about JavaScript (ES6, node.js, React...), you may find useful resources under [Learning Resource](http://bestofjs.org/tags/learning) tag in _Best of JavaScript_.
