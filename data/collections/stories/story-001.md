This is the very first issue of [Best of JavaScript Weekly](https://weekly.bestofjs.org) newsletter.

Every week, you will find here the 10 most popular projects from [Best of JavaScript](https://weekly.bestofjs.org) application.

[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) has been very hot over the last days, it's the hottest project of the week.

It's a great resource to learn about the basics of computer sciences: algorithms (quicksort, binary search...) and data structures (tree, linked list, graph...).

For developers coming from other languages who are already familiar with the concepts, it's a great way to see modern JavaScript in action, including testing with Jest.

See you next week!
