_NodeGUI_, the library to build desktop applications, is still at the top of the charts this week.

The newcomer is _AdminBro_, a solution to build automatically a CRUD application to manage your data.

It can work with two of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js: [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/).

You set up database adapters to connect to your data, right now 2 popular ORM are supported:

- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for SQL databases such as MySQL or Postgres
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for MongoDB databases.

The last step is to provide the models, once it's done you get a full CRUD application that you can plug-in to an existing Node.js application.

Using the scaffolding generated by _AdminBro_ as a starting point, it's possible to customize the look-and-feel with React components and the available actions.
