As promised in the previous issues, we'd like to introduce the [2019 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2019/en/).

For the 4th consecutive year, we compiled data about the trendiest projects on GitHub over the last 12 months.

And for the 4th year the overall winner is the same: _Vue.js_.

The goal of the project is to provide an overview of the JavaScript landscape in 2019.

Projects are organized using the tags from _Best of JavaScript_: UI frameworks, Node.js frameworks, React ecosystem...

It's available in Chinese and Spanish, anyone can contribute if you feel like adding comments for a given section.

Thank you for your feedback!
