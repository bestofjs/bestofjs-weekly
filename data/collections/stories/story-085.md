As promised last week, we'd like to introduce the [2019 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2019/en/).

For the 4th consecutive year, we compiled data about the trendiest projects on GitHub over the last 12 months. And for the 4th year the overall winner is the same: _Vue.js_.

We wanted to provide a complete overview of the JavaScript landscape in 2019. Rankings are organized using the tags from _Best of JavaScript_:

- UI frameworks (led by [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/))
- Node.js frameworks (led by [Nest](https://nestjs.com/))
- React ecosystem (led by [Ant Design](https://ant.design/))
- Vue.js ecosystem (led by [Vue Element Admin](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin))
- and much more!

It's available in Chinese and Spanish, anyone can contribute if you want to add comments for a given section. Thank you for your feedback!
