Number one this week, _Fusuma_ is a tool to create presentations in the browser using MDX language: a mix of markdown and JSX that lets you import any React component into the slides.

It provides basic themes but it's easy to customize the look and feel of the slides using CSS.

It comes with a command line tool to scaffold the project, run it and built it for production.

This tool is packed with impressive features.

For example the image to be displayed when the presentation is shared on social medias (`og:image`) is generated when building the project.
Also presentations can be exported as PDF documents.

The "Presenter Mode" can record your voice and replay the presentation showing a timeline to let you repeat your presentation until it's perfect.
