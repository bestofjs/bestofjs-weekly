Number one this week, _Themer_ is a CLI tool and an [online tool](https://themer.dev/) to generate themes for the applications you use on a daily basis:

- Code editors (VS Code, Ato,, Sublime Text...)
- Terminals (iTerm, Hyper, CMD.exe...)
- Chrome
- Slack

It can also generate wallpapers made of geometric shapes.

You provide a set of color (shades and accent colors) and it generate the files to download and include in your application.

Last but not least, you can share and bookmark your theme using the URLs generated by the online tool.
