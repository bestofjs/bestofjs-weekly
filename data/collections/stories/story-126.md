Number one this week, _React Chrono_ is a library to create timelines with React, written in TypeScript.

It works by providing events with a date, each event being rendered by a card on the screen.

Three layouts are available: horizontal, vertical or a nice **tree** that shows cards alternatively on both left and right sides.

It's possible to navigate using the keyboard arrows keys. One more fun feature: there is a "slideshow" mode to go automatically through all the timeline events.
