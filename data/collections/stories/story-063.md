If you check the rankings every week, you may have noticed that some projects come back, over and over.

Due to their popularity, _Vue.js_ and _React_ are always among the 10 projects that get the most stars during the week.

To be exact, _Vue.js_ was in the TOP 10 in 62 issues of a total of 62 issues, yes this means 100%!  
_React_ made the TOP 10 in 58 issues (94% of the issues).

In the other hand, people want to hear more about smaller projects that get traction during the previous weeks.

In order to promote more projects we are introducing this week a new type of ranking, based on the relative growth of projects.

So we are still evaluating the number of stars the project got on GitHub but we take into account the number of stars of the project to compute a ratio.

Of course, it's a tradeoff. A big project like React or Vue.js will NEVER be in the TOP 10 because they cannot match the relative growth rate of small projects.

So to get the best of the 2 worlds, we are publishing the 2 categories of rankings:

- "Growing Fast This Week": the projects by relative growth of number of stars
- "Trending This Week": the projects by number of stars added

It's a coincidence bur this week, it's the same project that leads the 2 categories: _Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript_.

Let us know what you think about these rankings, thank you!
