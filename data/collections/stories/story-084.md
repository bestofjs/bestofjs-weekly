Dear readers, we wish you a happy new year 2020!

Number one this week, _machinelearn.js_ is a library to run machine learning in Node.js and in the browser.

It hides the underlying mathematical concepts and exposes a simple API:

- `fit` for training the model from a data set (the "labeled examples")
- `predict` for computing predictions from new unlabeled data

It has a low entry barrier but there are a lot of features including several metrics to check how well your models perform.

If you are interested in this fascinating topic, check the [Machine Learning tag](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=ml) in _Best of JavaScript_.

Last week we promised that the _JavaScript Rising Stars_ would be back... we ask you to wait one more week.
I know it's hard to believe but it's just that we had too much work over the last days, thank you for your understanding!
