The hottest project of the week is _NodeGUI_ a library to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (JavaScript, HTML and CSS).

It's an alternative to [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that aims to solve issues related to performance and memory usage.

The main difference: it's not built on top of Chromium (the open-source engine used by Chrome browser and the next version of MicroSoft Edge). It uses [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), a solution to write GUI applications, written in C++.

The renderer for React, [React NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) has been very popular too, a starter kit is available.

_NoteGUI_ is at an early stage, it has only 9 contributors for now (compared to the 870 contributors for Electron!) but it will be interesting to see how the project grows and what the community builds from this library.
