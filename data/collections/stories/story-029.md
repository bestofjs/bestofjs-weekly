Number one this week _jsPDF_ is a library that generates PDF documents dynamically in the browser.

In a few lines of codes it's possible to write text, insert images or draw shapes in the document and let the user save the PDF file from the browser.

The [API](https://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/docs/jsPDF.html) lets you render the PDF document as a "data URI string" that can be assigned to a `<iframe>` element in your page, allowing the user to preview the PDF file before saving it.
