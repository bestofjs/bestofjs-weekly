Some of you may remember one of these "WIKIs" the Project Manager asked you to use to provide documentation about your code.

The lack of markdown support and syntax highlighting made them painful. They were so boring!

Fortunately, the project number one this week _Outline_ comes to the rescue.

Outline provides a "teamâ€™s knowledge base" to install on your infrastructure, made with a modern stack:

- Node.js and Koa for the backend
- React and Mobx for the frontend

You will need Postgres and Redis databases and a AWS account to store assets on S3 buckets.

One of the nice features is the Slack integration, since Slack became a hub to centralize the communication in a lot of teams.
Other [integrations](https://www.getoutline.com/integrations) are available too (GitHub, Trello, CodePen, Airtable...)

The project is open-source (otherwise it would not be on _Best of JavaScript_!) but if you don't want to manage anything about the infrastructure, a paid hosted version is available.

This business model seems similar to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) an open-source blog engine made with Node.js.
