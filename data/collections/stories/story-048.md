Number one this week, _Svelte_ is a revolutionary component framework to build web applications.

Like React or Vue, it lets developers build applications by creating components that update when data changes but the big difference is that the framework does not run in the browser, it runs at the building time.

The compiler is able to generate imperative code that manipulates the DOM directly from the components written by the developer.

Therefore the code shipped to the browser is both small and very fast to run (making Svelte applications suitable for embedded devices for example).

Besides its top notch performance, it's easy to create complex transitions that run in CSS.

The version 3 improves the concept of reactivity: updating a variable is all you need to trigger a change in the UI.
