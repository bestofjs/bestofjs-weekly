Number one this week, _Vime_ is a versatile video player written as a native Web Component.

Since it's built on top of [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) technology, it can be easily included in any page using only HTML markup.

Grab the JavaScript and CSS files from a CDN, insert a `<vmode-player>` tag anywhere in your page and you are good to go!

Styling is done using [CSS Custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), customizing the look- and-feel is as simple as overriding CSS variables.

Bindings for the most popular UI frameworks are provided: React, Angular, Vue, Stencil, Svelte and Preact.
