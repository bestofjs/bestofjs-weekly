Number one this week, _Graphery SVG_ is a lightweight library to create and manipulate SVG elements in the browser.

It can also be used on Node.js when doing server-side rendering.

Under the hood it uses [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to provide a straightforward API.

Basically all SVG attributes and properties can be set or read from methods such as `width()`, `height()` or `fill()`. All methods can be chained together making the code compact and easy to read (it reminds us the "method chaining" feature of jQuery).
