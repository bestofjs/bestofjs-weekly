_Alpine.js_ stays at the top of our rankings this week.

At position number two _Beautiful React Hooks_ is a collection of 25 hooks made to handle a lot of different use cases about:

- side effect related to the time (timer and interval)
- mouse events (pointer position, drag and drop events)
- scrolling events
- component life cycle
- ...

It's also a good way to learn about how to use the native hooks provided by React, like `useCallback` or `useRef` for example.

If you are interested in the topic, you should check [React Use](https://streamich.github.io/react-use) that covers a bigger scope.
