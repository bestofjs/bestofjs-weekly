The hottest project of the week is _eDEX-UI_ a terminal emulator that transforms your everyday work into a science-fiction movie.

It's made with Electron and installers are available for Mac, Windows and Linux.

Among the available features you can monitor your system and the network connections in real time. The on-screen keyboard makes this terminal perfect for touchable screens.

The author plans to add more features aimed to system admins (including multi monitor support).

A small note about new data available on _Best of JS_: now you can sort [projects by date of creation](https://bestofjs.org/projects?sort=created). it's interesting that the oldest projects we track were created in 2008 and are still active... who said JavaScript is moving too fast?
