If all you want for Christmas is a carousel, we have something for you!

Number one this week, _Tiny-Swiper_ is a library written in TypeScript to create sliders (or carousels) in web pages.

The core is lightweight (around 4 KB gzipped) as some extra features are available as "plugins":

- Pagination
- Lazy loading of slide content
- Keyboard controls
- Mouse wheel handling

Interestingly, it does not provide CSS, “you have to define style yourself" which allows a maximum of flexibility.
