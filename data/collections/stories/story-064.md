Following the concept introduced last week we are including 2 types of rankings this week too.

The "growing fast" project of the week is _TypeLighterJS_, a vanilla JavaScript plugin to animate text as if it was being typed.

It's very light (around 1 KB) and easy to integrate (just add data attributes in your HTML code).

The "trendiest" project of the week is _Reactide_, a code editor made specifically for React development.

The world of [open-source IDE for web developers](https://bestofjs.org/tags/ide) is still evolving... You may have tried _Brackets_, _Atom_ and for sure you have heard about _VS Code_ that is right now the "King".

The main point: _Reactide_ is already setup for React development, no developer tool to install (even if it's extensible).
For example, right out of the box it includes the "hot reload" mode and a "component tree" to visualize the application architecture.

The project is still under active development but the concept of integrating the developer tools right in the IDE (rather than relying on "devDependencies" to install and set up **for every project**) is really interesting.
