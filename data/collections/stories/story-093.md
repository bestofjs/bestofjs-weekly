Number one this week, _Panolens.js_ is a library to view panorama images, for browsers that support [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)

Given a large image (such as a landscape for example), the viewer lets the user scroll in all directions to discover all parts of the image.

It's built on top of the famous 3D library [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and the animation library [TweenJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/TweenJS).
