Number one this week, _Ztext_ is a library to apply 3D and animation effects on text, images and SVG elements in a web page.

It works by adding layers to the target elements and applying CSS inline styles such as `transform-style: preserve-3d`.

It's a simple and lightweight option (less than 4 kB g-zipped) to emphasize text in the client-side while keeping the text searchable and selectable.
