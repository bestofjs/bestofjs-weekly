Number one this week, _Ztext_ is a library to apply 3D and animation effects on text, images and SVG elements in a web page.

It works by applying CSS inline styles to the target elements, for example:

- `transform-style: preserve-3d`
- `transform: translateZ(0.5rem)`

It's a simple and lightweight option (less than 4 kB g-zipped) to emphasize text while keeping the text selectable.
