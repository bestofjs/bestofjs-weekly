Number one this week, _Uppy_ is a library that provides a really nice UI to upload files from the browser.

It has a system of plugins to enhance the core features, letting users upload files from the device camera or from several "remote providers" such as Google Drive or Dropbox, for example.

Among the interesting features, one of the available plugins uses the browser LocalStorage to be able to resume the uploading process if the browser crashes.

It may be one of the most complete solutions under the [upload](https://bestofjs.org/tags/upload) tag.
