Number one this week, _Uppy_ is a library that provides a really nice UI to upload files from the browser.

It has a system of plugins to enhance the core features, letting users pick files from the device camera or from several "remote providers" such as Google Drive or Dropbox, for example.

Files can be uploaded to any backend, one of the available plugins targets AWS S3 buckets.

Among the interesting features, a plugin called "Golden Retriever" uses the browser LocalStorage to be able to resume the uploading process if the browser crashes.

It's vanilla JavaScript but React components and a Redux store implementation are available.
