Number one this week, _TypeFest_ is a collection of types to improve your TypeScript code.

The project is from the prolific developer [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) who did a great job explaining the use case behind each type and providing links to the TypeScript playground.

It's also a nice project to learn about TypeScript built-in types (`Partial`, `Required`, `ReturnType`, `Omit`...) and how to combine them.

Expect the project to move fast as users made a lot of proposals to add new types and because TypeScript itself is moving at a fast pace, check the latest features introduced by the [version 4.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/) released 10 days ago.
