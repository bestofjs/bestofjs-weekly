Number one this week, _Elder.js_ is a new static site powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), the UI framework that works at build time and has been very popular over the last months.

Static site generators are tools to create a bunch of HTML pages that can hosted and served by any static hosting solution.
They work by fetching data from multiple sources (often markdown files but also API, database...) at build time, instead of run time.
They are a very popular option to build blogs or documentation sites.

In the React eco-system, the trendiest projects are [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) while Vue.js has [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/).

In addition of the Svelte templates, one of the main features of _Elder.js_ is the "SEO focused" routing that lets you define any permanent link for any page.

Compared to [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) the fullstack framework powered by Svelte, _Elder.js_ provides better performance at build time, being able to generate quickly thousands of pages.
