_Zero_, the Node.js server that requires no configuration to serve all kind of assets, is the project number one of the week, again.

Among the top 10 projects, it's worth to mention _Storybook_, a tool to help developer build components **in isolation**.

It's a versatile tool that be used for prototyping, building documentation, testing...

It supports all modern UI frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Ember...

The [version 5](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-5-0-db1d0f9c83b8) has just been released. It's a major update that includes a brand new design and a lot of new features about the theming and the architecture for addons.

The application itself is built with a library of re-usable React components that is available in NPM, under the package name `@storybook/components`.
