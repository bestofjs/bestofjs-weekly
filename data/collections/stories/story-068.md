Number one this week, _Draqula_ is a light-weight GraphQL client for React applications.

It claims to be a very simple alternative to the feature-rich [Apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client).

It provides two hooks (`useQuery` and `useMutation`) to read and update data using queries written in GraphQL syntax. As we mentioned last week, hooks are more and more used by React libraries that provide cross-cutting functionalities like routing, form validation or data fetching.

Note that the project is not ready for production yet, you could have a look at [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql) if you need a more advanced solution.
