Number one this week, _Squeezer Framework_ is a solution to build "dApps" with JavaScript.

dApps, or decentralized applications, work without centralized server and use smart contracts to enable secured transactions between peers.

The Squeezer approach, based on microservices, aims to solve problems related to scalability and access to blockchain data.

Running the CLI, you can build in a few seconds an application such as a payment or a voting system. Later it can be deployed to the "Squeezer Platform", an architecture that runs serverless functions.

It can work with any blockchain because it uses an agnostic blockchain integration called "ChainKit".
