Number 2 last week, _Puppeteer Recorder_ reaches the top position this week.

The story of the week is about _Lerna_, a tool used to publish several packages from a single repository.

It's used by a lot of famous projects including _Babel_, _Jest_ or _create-react-app_.

There was a buzz around the project (hence its 8th position) because of a controversial move made by one of its core maintainers.

James Kyle wanted to prevent some major companies from using Lerna, by changing the terms of the license. The change has been [reverted](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1633) after a lot of discussions about politics opinions in open source communities.
