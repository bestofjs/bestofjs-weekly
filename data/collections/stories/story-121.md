The story of the week is about _Moment_ the most popular library to handle dates and times, created in 2011.

It will not get new features anymore, as mentioned on GitHub:

> Moment.js is a legacy project, now in maintenance mode

As a result, one of the modern alternatives _Day.js_ is the trendiest project of the week, and _Luxon_, the successor of Moment is not far behind.

You may be interested in [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) if you need something "like Lodash for dates".
