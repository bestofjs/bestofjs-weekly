Number one this week, _Financial_ is a library written in TypeScript to perform elementary financial operations about payments and interest rates.

Speaking of calculations, _x-spreadsheet_ is a library to include a spreadsheet in a web page, using a `<canvas>` element, to get something similar to Google Sheets for example.

The features include:

- basic "formulas": sum, average, concat...
- undo / redo
- copy-paste of range of cells
- formatting options

If you need a spreadsheet in your web page, check the other contenders on _Best of JS_ like [SheetJS](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) or [jExcel](https://github.com/paulhodel/jexcel) that we mentioned one year ago in a [previous issue](https://weekly.bestofjs.org/issues/56/).
