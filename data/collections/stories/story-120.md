Number one this week, _Stitches_ is a [CSS-in-JS](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=css-in-js) library to style React components.

Compared to the other contenders ([Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) being the most popular options) it claims to be simple, lightweight and fast.

It works by generating unique "atomic" class names at build time, from styled components created using JavaScript objects.

The features include theming, style tokens, responsive design break-points, and the concept of "variants" to let developers adjust component styles based on any "props".

Last but not least it provides a great developer experience thanks to the TypeScript support and the ability to create one's custom utils.
