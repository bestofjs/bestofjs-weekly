Number one this week, _tinyhttp_ is a Node.js web server that claims to be a modern alternative to _Express_.

It only supports recent versions of Node.js (from v12.4) and it's written in TypeScript.

Developers familiar with Express API will feel at home at it uses a similar system of route handlers, using the usual `req` and `res` objects.

The "Full compatibility with Express" is a great argument as Express (released in 2009!) has a huge eco-system of "middlewares" to extend its core functionalities.
