We mentioned in [2019 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2019/en/) the success of [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), a solution from Google to take control of a headless Chrome browser in order to automate tasks. It was the project number 1 of the testing category.

Number one this week, _Playwright_ from Microsoft goes one step further by offering a unified API to control any Chromium, Webkit or Firefox browser.

The code examples show how you can easily emulate Safari or Chrome on mobile devices and take screenshots of the web pages.

Also it supports the new Microsoft Edge browser, based on Chromium.

It's worth mentioning that the next releases of Puppeteer will go in a similar direction by supporting Firefox.
