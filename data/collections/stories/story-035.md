Number one this week, `fx` is a handy command-line tool to manipulate JSON data, from files saved on your disk or from REST APIs.

The main features:

- You can use any native JavaScript function to manipulate data: `map`, `filter` and `slice` for example
- The interactive mode that lets you navigate through the nodes of the JSON tree, in a very keyboard-friendly way.
- You can enhance the tool to do powerful requests and aggregations, using famous libraries like Ramda or Lodash or your own JavaScript snippets.
