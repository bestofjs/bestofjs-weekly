Number one this week, `js-fire` is a library that can transform any function (or Object returning functions) into a CLI application.

Functions can be nested at will, the interactive mode is very convenient to explore the available functions without having to check the "help" command.

Under the hood it uses [Inquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) library to display user-friendly prompts in the command line.

It can also be used to explore the API of any Node.js package from the command line.
