This week the new ranking system (based on the relative growth of number of stars) is led by _Radial Menu_, a library to include a circular menu in your web application.

A position number 2, _React Hook Form_ is one of these projects that take advantage of "hooks" (a feature introduced in React version 16.8 in February) to simplify the development of React components.

At position number 3, it's _Dojo_, it may be a familiar face for some of you who remember the early days of Ajax in the browser when libraries like Prototype.js, Mootools, jQuery were battling. This Dojo library is the successor of the "Doko Toolkit" created in 2004, and it's based on Web Components.
