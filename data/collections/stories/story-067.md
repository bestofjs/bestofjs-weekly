This week the new ranking system (based on the relative growth of number of stars) is led by _Radial Menu_, a library to include a circular menu in your web application.

A position number 2, _React Hook Form_ is one of these projects that take advantage of "hooks" to simplify the development of React components. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8, released in February.

At position number 3, the name _Dojo_ may sound familiar for some of you who remember the early days of Ajax in the browser when libraries like Prototype.js, Mootools or jQuery were battling.

This Dojo library is the successor of the "Doko Toolkit" created in 2004. It still provides a full set of sophisticated widgets such as data tables and form components.
But Dojo is a complete and modern framework written in TypeScript that includes features like state management, routing and internationalization inside the box.
The components are written using "tsx" syntax (that looks very similar to React's jsx) and can be compiled into Web Components.
