Behind _Vue.js_ and _Algorithm Visualizer_, the newcomer in the TOP 10 this week is _Filepond_, a library to upload files from the browser.

_Filepond_ shines with its features related to image uploads. The online demo is really neat:

- The "image preview" plugin provides a thumbnail of your image while it's being uploaded
- A nice visual effect emphasizes the end of the upload process.

It comes with different flavors (Vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue.js...) and has a "crystal clear" documentation.

Its main competitor may be [Uppy](https://uppy.io/) that was hot on _Best of JavaScript_ a few weeks ago.
