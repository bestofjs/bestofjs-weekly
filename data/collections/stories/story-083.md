_Sarus_ a library to handle [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) connections, is the last project featured in 2019.

It can make applications more resilient by reconnecting automatically to the server if the connection is lost. And its weight is only 1.5kB.

A short update about _Best of JavaScript_: we added a link called "Tags" to the top navigation menu, to browse the content of the tags we use to categorize all the projects.
