The last project highlighted in 2019 is _Sarus_: a library to handle [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) connections.
Its weight is only 1.5 kB but it can make applications more resilient by reconnecting automatically to the server if the connection is lost.

A short update about _Best of JavaScript_: we added a link called "Tags" to the top navigation menu. Go to https://bestofjs.org/tags to check at a glance all the tags we use to categorize the projects. Reach us on GitHub to give us feedback!

Next time, we will check the trendiest projects of the year. The famous _JavaScript Rising Stars_ will be back, stay tuned!
