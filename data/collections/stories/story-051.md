Number one this week, _CSSFX_ is a collection of more than 40 CSS snippets to add beautiful effects on your web pages.

For example:

- Show a nice and original loading animation while data is loading
- Add a nice effect on an input field when it gets the focus
- Highlight a button when the mouse is over

Great for emphasizing some user actions... or just to make your web site stand from the crowd!

The project itself is made using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), a framework to build web applications and static sites with _Vue.js_ components but the CSS snippets provided don't require any JavaScript code, they can be included in any web page.
