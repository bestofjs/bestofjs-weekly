The charting library _roughViz.js_ is back at the top of the rankings this week.

At position number 2, _Goober_ is a lightweight alternative to [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/), two of the most popular "CSS-in-JavaScript" solutions.

Like these 2 libraries, the API provides a `styled()` function that can be used to apply styling to a given component or a HTML tag.

To write the styles, you could use either the CSS syntax inside [template tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) or you can use a regular JavaScript object.

It works with React and Preact components, the API also provides a `css()` function to be used with vanilla JavaScript.

_Goober_ will automatically create CSS classes, added to the `<head>` tag of the document.

One more thing, don't forget to take the [State of JavaScript 2019 survey](https://survey.stateofjs.com/), we need your input!
