For the first time in 2019 (and probably not the last time) Vue.js gets the number one spot in our weekly rankings.

In an interesting [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB3HOejXqwk), the creator of Vue.js Evan You sums up the biggest changes over the last months, including:

- Improvements of the toolchain with _vue-cli_
- The release of _Vuepress_, the static site generator that can be used to create blogs or documentation sites for example

Also he mentions the latest changes brought by the the version 2.6, and especially the new syntax for "scoped slots" (read [So Whatâ€™s New in Vue 2.6?](https://blog.bitsrc.io/so-whats-new-in-vue-2-6-d070132b2045) for more details).

There is no exact schedule for the release of the version 3 that will bring a lot of improvements including:

- Support for async/await actions in _Vuex_ (the state management solution for Vue.js applications)
- Better support for TypeScript users

About the future, it's interesting to see how Vue.js is inspired by patterns seen in React (hooks, time slicing).
