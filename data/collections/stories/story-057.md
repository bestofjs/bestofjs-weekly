Number one this week, _Every Programmer Should Know_ is a collection of useful links for developers, gathered in a single document written in Markdown.

It's not only about JavaScript but it includes a lot of links related to web development: how JavaScript works, SEO, security in web applications...

At the position number 2, _Just_ is a library to build **tasks** such as compiling, testing and building a web project... Tasks can run any JavaScript code, are composable, and can easily be called from the command line.

Just includes by default some tasks that are especially useful if you run a web project using TypeScript, Webpack and Jest.
