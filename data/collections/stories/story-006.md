This week, we have a new face at the number 1 position! _Canner_ is not a CMS but a framework to build any CMS.

Schemas are written once and the framework provide connectors to connect any data store, including [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) GraphQL servers.

An interesting feature: it lets developers configure everything using JSX, the syntax made popular by React.

Talking about "faces", the TOP 10 features _face-api.js_, a project that does face detection in the browser, using the [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library.

It seems that JavaScript has no limit!
