Number one this week, _Vest_ is a library to validate data (user's input when a form is submitted for example) that uses a syntax similar to how unit tests are written.

For people familiar with testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha, it's an interesting alternative to libraries like [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) or [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), check the [Validation tag](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=validation) on _Best of JS_ for more details.
