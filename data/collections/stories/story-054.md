Behind _Zdog_ (the pseudo 3D engine that was number 1 last week) _Algorithm Visualizer_ is the hottest project of the week.

It provides a way to visualize in the browser how algorithms work by showing both the actual code and its effect on data.

You can run the code step by step, pause it, change the speed...

You will find old friends like "Quicksort" and a lot of other algorithms, including the "PageRank" algorithm used by Google to rank web sites.

This fascinating web application, written with React and Redux, is a great way to learn about algorithms.
