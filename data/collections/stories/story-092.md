Number one this week, _Destiny_ is a brand new tool to automatically organize the file system of a JavaScript (or TypeScript) project.

It works by analyzing the `import` statement of all code files and as a result it moves and rename your files, creating a new structure.

It claims to be the equivalent of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), this super convenient tool that format lines of code following style rules, in a deterministic way.

We can spend a lot of time trying to find the best file system for our projects, asking ourselves where should be shared components for example (should they belong to a folder called `utils` or `common`? Should it be higher in the hierarchy?)

Also it can be used to detect "dead lines" of code, that is to say files that not imported by any other file.
Such a tool can be a time saver!
