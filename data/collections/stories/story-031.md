Number one this week, _Ant Design_ is the second most popular set of UI components for React on GitHub, just behind [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

With 60 available components, it provides all the widgets you need to build catchy web or desktop applications: auto-complete, carousels, drawers, trees, notifications...

It's used by some of the giants of the internet in China (Alibaba, Tencent).

Also it's available to Angular users, under the name [ng-zorro](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en).

It was the last post of 2018, see you next year!
