Number one this week, _Nanopop_ is a "positioning engine": it computes the position of floating elements in a web page.
It can be used to display a dropdown menu or a tooltip for example.

One of the most popular solutions in this category is [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/), it's a dependency of famous projects such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) or [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

_Nanopop_ claims to be solution with a smaller footprint (less than 1 kB g-zipped). Being at a lower level, it has less features but it's easier to customize to fit your needs.

The author has two other projects on Best of JavaScript including a nice color picker called [Pickr](https://simonwep.github.io/pickr/). Under the hood it uses _Nanopop_ as its positioning engine.
