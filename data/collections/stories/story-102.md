Number one this week, _Î¼Plot_ is a charting library that focuses on delivering top-notch performance with a light footprint.

According to the benchmark it can display more than 160k points in the browser faster than any of the contenders (and the [charting](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=chart) category has a lot of contenders!)

It's based on the browser `<canvas>` element, it does not uses SVG elements like the popular [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Chartist](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) libraries for example.

A short update about [Best of JavaScript](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=chart), the application is now 100% hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com): the frontend (SPA built with _Create React App_) and the backend (serverless functions).
The developer experience provided by this service is really amazing.
Let us know if you notice any problem after the migration, thank you!
