Almost one year ago, _Deno_, a new JavaScript runtime that aims to solve some of the defects of Node.js, was the top project of second issue.

The project is still not production ready but it has gained a lot of traction over the last months, getting contributions of more than 140 people.

The version 1.0 is expected by the end of the summer so you will hear about _Deno_ very soon, for sure.

Speaking of Node.js, the latest version (12.6) brings a powerful feature: the `workers_thread` module, now available without special flags. We often hear that Node.js is not good at performing heavy computations because of its single-thread architecture, the ability of create a main thread and several workers may change the game.
