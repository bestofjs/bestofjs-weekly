Number one this week, _Grid.js_ is a plugin to add a data table in a web page.

It's written in TypeScript and plays well with any framework (or no framework at all!).

It can be used to either fetch dynamically data and build the table or to enhance an existing table providing features such as:

- pagination (client-side and server-side)
- searching (filtering the rows to match what the user types in an input field)
- sorting by clicking on the column headers

If you are interested in data tables and spreadsheets in the web, check the [Table tag](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=table) in _Best of JavaScript_.
