Number one this week, _InfiniteGrid_ is a JavaScript library to arrange card elements on the screen by creating various kinds of layout:

- "grid layouts" to make images with the same width stack properly
- "justified layouts" to arrange the content by rows
- "square layouts" to arrange squared images of different size, creating a nice checkerboard
- and many more, check the documentation to see all the layouts in action.

An interesting point is the focus on performance: as the user scrolls through the elements, the library automatically re-uses the DOM elements that leave the viewport, to keep the number of DOM elements constant.

Let's finish with a short update about _Best of JavaScript_.

We have improved the page that shows the project's details. In addition of the heat map that shows the stars added day by day, we provide a graph of the stars added month by month, to get a better understanding of the overall trends.
