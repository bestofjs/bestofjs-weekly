This week, we'd like to announce the release of the [JavaScript Rising Stars 2020](https://risingstars.js.org/), our annual round-up of the JavaScript landscape.

Check out the projects that got the most stars on GitHub in 2020.

This year we have 2 new "guest writers":

- [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) for the _React Ecosystem_ category
- [Sebastien Lorber](https://sebastienlorber.com/) for the _Build Tools_ category

Not only [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) leads two different categories but the _Rising Stars_ project itself is now built on top of _Next.js_ (instead of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) the previous years).

And guess who is the overall winner? Hint: it's a dinosaur... and it wears a mask of course!
