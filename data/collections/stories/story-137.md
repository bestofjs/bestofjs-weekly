Number one this week, _AnimXYZ_ is a solution to animate elements in the browser by applying classes and specific attributes to HTML elements.

It can be used with raw HTML, no JavaScript is needed, as the core package is made of CSS code (written in Sass actually).
It also comes with convenient components for React and Vue.js.

It can be customized by editing CSS variables.

The concept of composing animations by adding different classes reminds us of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), one of the big winners of our annual [Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/).

Speaking of the _Rising Stars_, the project is now available in Russian, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese, special thanks to the translators!
