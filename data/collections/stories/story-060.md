Number one this week, _Clean Code JavaScript_ is an adaptation of the book _Clean Code_ intended for JavaScript developers.

_Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ is a famous book by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob) about how to write code that is easy to read and to maintain.

The first edition of the book was published 11 years ago, but the principles are still valid and the reading is highly recommended whether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran.

Compared to the original book, the _Clean Code JavaScript_ project is only a compact list a of good practices to apply to your JavaScript code.

If you need a more in-depth reading about JavaScript, _You don't know JavaScript_ (number 4 this week) from Kyle Simpson is a must-read.

Speaking of books, there is a specific [Book category](https://bestofjs.org/tags/book) in _Best of JavaScript_.
