Number one this week, _Rsup Progress_ is a library to add a simple progress bar on top of your web pages.

It has an interesting concept: it starts very fast, slows down as it advances and it never completely reaches the right border of your page.
So you can use it without having to worry about how much time your process will take.

In a way it's like a lot of projects in the real life: we start fast, we get bored and we never reach the goal we had :)

One more thing, a new feature has been added on _Best of JavaScript_: for NPM packages, you can monitor the number of downloads by clicking on "Monthly downloads" link, in the project details page. Thank you for your feedback!
