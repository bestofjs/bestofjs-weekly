Number one this week, _Notyf_ is a library to give feedback to the user by creating "toast notifications", those small unobtrusive messages that usually show up at the top of the screen and disappear by themselves, after an important action or an error.

At the position number 2, _Eclipse Theia_ is a platform to build your own code editor. It claims to be a "Vendor-Neutral Open Source" alternative to VS Code.

The version 1.0 has just been released, check [the official announcement](https://dev.to/svenefftinge/theia-1-0-finally-a-good-browser-ide-3ok0).

It can be used to create a desktop or cloud-based editor. It comes with a whole eco-system of extensions, available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/).
