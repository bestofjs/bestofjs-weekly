For the third time in 2019, _Uppy_ is the trendiest project of the week.

Uppy is a modular file uploader that can fetch files from local disk, Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, remote URLs, cameras...

_Svelte_, the framework to build web applications that runs at build time, number one last week, drops at the second place.

At position number 3, _Sheperd_ is a tool to introduce a web application with a step-by-step guide. It can be useful to create a well-crafted onboarding experience, highlighting the main features of an application by adding tooltips on the screen.

If you need to create a tour of your application, you can also have a look at [IntroJS](http://introjs.com/), the most popular alternative.
