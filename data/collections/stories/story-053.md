Number one this week, _Zdog_ is a library to animate in 3D simple shapes such as circles, rectangles, cylinders, "boxes"...

It can render shapes on either a `<canvas>` or a SVG element.

The online demos show how you can rotate objects by dragging on the screen, using a very few lines of JavaScript.

It's not a real 3D engine ("Zdogâ€™s 3D shapes are actually 2D projections rendered without any accounting for collisions with other shapes" as the author says) but its simple API and its small bundle size (less than 7 KB gzipped) make it very interesting.

Fun fact: its name and its concept is inspired by a virtual pet games of the 90's, called "Dogz"!
