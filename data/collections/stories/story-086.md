Number one this week, _Alpine.js_ is a minimalist reactive framework for the browser.

It borrows ideas from both Vue.js and Angular: custom HTML directives, double-way binding...

It's very easy to check it using with a good old `<script>` tag added to an HTML page, no building process is needed, everything can be done right from the HTMl mark-up.

Everything starts with a `x-data` directive used to assign a scope and data to a given DOM element.

Then, other DOM elements can interact with data in the scope and events can be triggered using `x:on` directive.

The project is at an early stage, some features like the communication between components are missing but it's a refreshing experience.
