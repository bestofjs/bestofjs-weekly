Number one this week, _Node.js Best Practices_ is a collection of more than 80 articles about building real-world Node.js applications.

The content is split into 8 sections:

- Project Structure (layering components, configuration...)
- Error handling
- Code style
- Testing and quality
- Going to production (monitoring, logging, using reverse proxies, CPU cores, memory usage...)
- Security (rate limiting, handling untrusted data...)
- Performance

Each point is explained in a concise paragraph but the reader can go deeper and see code in action by clicking on "Read more" links.
