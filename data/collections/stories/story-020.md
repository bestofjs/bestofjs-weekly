The collection of snippets _30 seconds of code_ is our number one for the third consecutive week.

At position number 2, _Walt_ is an attempt to let web developers write Web Assembly code using a syntax very close to JavaScript, instead of languages like C or Rust.

Compared to JavaScript, code written in Web Assembly can be run very fast in the browser. Read more about what makes Web Assembly fast [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/what-makes-webassembly-fast/).

One last thing: we have just introduced [a new feature](https://medium.com/@michael.rambeau/checking-the-licenses-about-1200-javascript-packages-8e1552ba99df) in _Best of JavaScript_, you can know see all the licenses of a given NPM package and **all** its dependencies.
