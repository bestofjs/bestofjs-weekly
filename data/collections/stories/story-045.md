A lot of web developers remember the time when jQuery was the de-factor library to build anything in the browser.

It helped a lot to do things without worrying about the quirks and the inconsistencies of the browsers:

- Perform Ajax requests
- Query the DOM to show or hide elements in the page
- Animate elements... how sweet was `$('mySelector').fadeOut()`?
- And so many other things... jQuery was the Swiss Army knife of web developers!

And let's not forget the nice [documentation](http://api.jquery.com/).

But things have changed, browsers have improved a lot, and they follow new standards... that have been inspired by the jQuery API: `document.querySelector()` for example.

Nowadays web applications usually rely on frameworks like React, Vue.js or Angular that flavor different patterns.

To help with the transition to the post-jQuery era, _You don't need jQuery_ project shows how to do a lot of common tasks using plain JavaScript, without any library.

Also we should mention a similar project: [You might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/).
