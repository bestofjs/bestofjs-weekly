Number one this week, _Watermelon_ is a reactive database for React Native or React web applications.

It uses SQLite database for React Native or [Loki](http://lokijs.org/) (an in-memory database that runs in the browser) for the web.

It emphasizes performance on mobile devices and real-time updates, using the Observable pattern from the [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) library.

At position number 2, _Pigeon Maps_ is a super-light alternative to Google Maps, if you need to embed maps in your React application.
