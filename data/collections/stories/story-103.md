The biggest news of the week may be the official V1 release of _Deno_, the server-side JavaScript runtime created by Ryan Dahl, announced in [this blog post](https://deno.land/v1).

It's often considered as the sequel of Node.js as it fixes or improves a lot of points, taking advantage of 10 years of experience and iterations with Node.js.

Among the main features:

- TypeScript compiler is included by default (but you can write code in regular JavaScript)
- No centralized package manager, any JavaScript dependency can be loaded from any URL
- The "standard library" provides solutions for common needs that usually require the installation of packages in Node.js
- Deno uses as much as possible standards from the web (Example: the `fetch` API)
- Files imported using the ECMAScript modules
- Built-in test runner and debugger

The [ecosystem around Deno](https://deno.land/x/) is quite young but expect things to change a lot, given the buzz around Deno.

The project has grown a lot since the first time we mentioned in the [issue number 2](https://weekly.bestofjs.org/issues/2/), 2 years ago. Time flies!
