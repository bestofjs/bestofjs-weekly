The biggest news of the week is the [official announcement of Rome's beta release](https://romefrontend.dev/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html).

_Rome_ is a tool created by Sebastian McKenzie (the creator of Babel) to handle common front-end development tasks.

The current tooling eco-system is very fragmented, each task has its own tools, for example:

- Formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint
- Building with Webpack, Parcel or Rollup
- Testing with Jest, Mocha or Ava...

However _Rome_ aims to provide a unified set of tools to handle JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML or markdown files, leading to a much simpler developer experience.

_Rome_ may be the success-story of 2020, this is why we have included it in a short timeline we released this week: https://bestofjs.org/timeline.
