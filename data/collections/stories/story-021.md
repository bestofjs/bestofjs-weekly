Number 1 this week, _Evergreen_ is a set of flexible and polished React components.

It includes all the basic bricks of web applications (buttons, form controls...) and more advanced components such as autocomplete fields or toaster alerts.

At position number 2, _Omi_ is a very promising UI framework that takes advantage of the [Shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) technology, while using the "JSX" syntax, familiar to React developers.
