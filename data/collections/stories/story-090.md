Number one this week, _Baretest_ is a minimalist testing framework for "developers who genuinely value performance and usability".

It's a very lightweight alternative of frameworks such as Jest, Mocha or Ava, the champions of the [Testing](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=test-framework) category.

It has a compact API, it runs super fast according to the benchmarks and it adds only 16 kB to your `node_modules` folder.
