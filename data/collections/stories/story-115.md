At the first position _Tinykeys_ is a very small library from [Jamie Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds) to handle keyboard events in order to add keyboard shortcuts to a web application.

It can bind combinations of keys pressed at the same time or in order, taking into account special key modifiers such as Ctrl and Shift.

At the position number 3 _GPU.js_ is a library to perform heavy calculations in parallel by using the GPU instead of the CPU.

Under the hood it uses [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) in the browser and [HeadlessGL](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl) in Node.js.
