_visx_ is a collection of data "visualization primitives" for React applications, open sourced by Airbnb.

It's built on top of the hugely popular [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) that received a major update a few weeks ago: the [version 6](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md).

Features are split into small packages to let users import only what they need: axis, curves, annotations, scale functions...

It does not provide styling because it claims to be "not a charting library", instead it gives developers the full control to create beautiful graphs by composing React components.

If you need charts in your React application, check all the contenders [here](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=chart&tags=react).
