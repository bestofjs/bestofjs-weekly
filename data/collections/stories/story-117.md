Number one this week, _Embla Carousel_ is a lightweight library to create sliders (also called "carousels") in the browser.

It shines with its touch/gesture features: you can make the slides scroll by dragging the images in a very natural way.

It can be used without any JavaScript framework but it also provides a hook for easy integration with React.

Check the [online examples](https://davidcetinkaya.github.io/embla-carousel/examples) to see the carousels in actions... It's always good to see pictures of cats if you need to relax before starting a new week! üê±
