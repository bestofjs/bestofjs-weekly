Number one this week, _Edtr.io_ is a rich text editor written with React.

It's built on top of [Slate](http://slatejs.org/) (a framework to build WYSIWYG editors) and it can be enhanced by a system of plugins.

The homepage is a live example that lets you edit the content on the screen, re-ordering the paragraphs by drag and drop.

Also we'd like to introduce the latest changes about _Best of JavaScript_.

Three elements have been added to to the homepage to make it more attractive:

- **Newest projects**: the latest projects added to Best of JavaScript
- **Featured Projects**: a selection of important projects, showing randomly on the screen... could you recognize all the logos?
- **Weekly Newsletter**: the latest issue of our newsletter including the rankings by relative growth.

Let us know what you think, thank you for your feedback!
