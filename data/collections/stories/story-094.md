Number one this week, _Edtr.io_ is a rich text editor (also called "WYSIWYG" editor) written with React.

It's built on top of [Slate](http://slatejs.org/) a framework to build WYSIWYG editors and it can be enhanced by a system of plugins.

It aims to "make creating content online as simple as editing a Word document - or simpler", with a focus on great UX.

The homepage is a live example that lets you edit the content on the screen. For example it's possible to re-order the paragraphs by drag and drop, in a nice and intuitive way.
