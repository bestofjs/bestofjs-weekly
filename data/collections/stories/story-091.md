Number one this week, _Beluga_ is a solution to build self-hosted e-commerce sites using Node.js in the backend and React in the frontend.

The goal is to let developers take "full control" of the look and feel of their online store with components written in JSX, instead of relying on the templates usually provided by the e-commerce platforms.

It uses the payment platform Stripe not only for payment processing but also for handling inventory, customer and order data, no database is needed.

Emails are sent to customers by [Nodemail](http://nodemailer.com/) package using the GMail REST API, the templates are written in [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
