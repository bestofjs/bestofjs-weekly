Number one this week, _React Hook Form_ is a library to handle forms in React applications using hooks.

It's lightweight (no dependencies) and it has a minimal API.

The documentation shows clearly how it's easy to add form validation to your components, comparing the implementation of a simple email registration form with 2 popular alternatives: [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/) and [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik).

The biggest difference with the other libraries is the fact that form inputs are not "controlled", there is no rendering cycle triggered every time the user enters a key in a text field for example, this is a good point for performance.
