Number one this week, _AdminBro_ is a solution to easily generate a full CRUD application from database models.

It can be used with SQL and NoSQL databases since the following ORM/ODM are supported:

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for MongoDB
- [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/) for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server...
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MS SQL Server

It works by adding new routes to any Node.js web server built on top of popular frameworks such as Express or Hapi.

We mentioned it last year [in the issue 66](https://weekly.bestofjs.org/issues/66/), the project keeps growing and now supports [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [Koa](https://koajs.com/).
