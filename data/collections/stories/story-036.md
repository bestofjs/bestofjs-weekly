Number one this week, _Ink_ lets you build Command Line applications using the component-based approach and the JSX syntax from React.

You can mix the available built-in components and your own stateful or stateless components to build an application rendered in the Command Line.

The version 2 will be released soon, it will use directly the React renderer engine and [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga), a flexbox layout engine from Facebook.
