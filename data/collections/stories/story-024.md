Number 1 this week, _Carlo_ is a project that lets Node.js take control of a locally installed Chrome browser.

It reminds the scope of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) projects but it's built on top of [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and it focuses on productivity rather than on branding features for desktop applications.

Examples in the repository show how to display in the browser information related to the system (OS, battery...).

Basically with _Carlo_ developers can provide a visual interface, using web technologies, for things that are usually controlled from the command line.

We can expect projects like scaffolding tools or test runners that will take advantage of this new "Headful Note app framework".
