Number 1 this week, _30 seconds of code_ is a collection of more than 300 snippets of JavaScript ES6 code, classified under tags such as:

* Array
* Browser
* Date
* Function
* Math
* Node

It's a great way to learn JavaScript by the example, all the snippets are concise and well commented.

Also it can be helpful if you don't _want_ or if you _can't_ include in your code a "utils" library like Lodash or any micro-package.
