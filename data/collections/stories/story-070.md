Number one this week, `Geometric.js` is a library for doing geometry in Nodes.js and in the browser. It handles points, line segments, polygons and angles.

It can be used to transform these objects (translate, rotate...) or to check if their intersect for example.

There is not any specific data structure, no sophisticated type, it works only with plain functions that expect (and return) either numbers or array of numbers. A point is just an an array of 2 numbers and a polygon is an array of array... it's that simple!
